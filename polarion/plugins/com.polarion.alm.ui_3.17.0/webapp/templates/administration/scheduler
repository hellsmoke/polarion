#info("Scheduler allows you to configure *scheduled jobs* such as builds, dashboard updates, system cleanup, etc. Polarion comes with a default set of scheduled jobs. You can alter the properties of scheduled jobs, such as the day of the week when the job should run. You can also add additional scheduled jobs to the default set, or remove jobs from the default jobs set.\\
You can optionally invoke any job explicitly in the *Monitor* topic. Order of the jobs in Monitor is defined by their order in the configuration file.")

1.1 Quick Help
Each job is defined by a <tt>job</tt> element. The ~~name~~, ~~id~~ and ~~scope~~ parameters are required. Sub-elements are job-specific. Here is the basic syntax for defining a scheduled job:\\
<tt>
  &lt;job name="Job Name" id="job.id" cronExpression="0 0 0 ? \* \*" disabled="true|__false__" scope="system"&gt;\\
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;subElement1&gt;value&lt;/subElement1&gt;\\
  &lt;/job&gt;
</tt>

1.1.1.1.1.1 Parameter: ~~name~~
Name of the job that is shown in the jobs table in Monitor topic. Required.

1.1.1.1.1.1 Parameter: ~~id~~
Job id as it is specified in its deployment. Required.

1.1.1.1.1.1 Parameter: ~~scope~~
Scope of the job. Must be one of:
* <tt>project:&lt;project_id&gt;</tt>
* <tt>path:&lt;repository_path&gt;</tt>
* <tt>system</tt>
Required.

1.1.1.1.1.1 Parameter: ~~disabled~~
Set <tt>disabled="true"</tt> to disable automatic scheduling of the particular job. The job still appears in the Jobs table and can be started manually.

1.1.1.1.1.1 Parameter: ~~node~~
Set a cluster node where job will be executed. Possible values are:
* ~~unspecified~~ - scheduler will choose one of the nodes
* <tt>node="\*"</tt> - will be executed on all nodes in a cluster
