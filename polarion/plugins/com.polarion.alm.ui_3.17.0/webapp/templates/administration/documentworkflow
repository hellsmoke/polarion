1.1 Quick Help

The table above shows the workflow configurations currently defined for *Documents*. In general, configurations can be Global or project in their scope. The ~~Scope~~ column indicates the scope of 
the configuration currently in use. A Document workflow configuration can also be specific to one or more Document types. \\

There are two simple rules that define the order in which configurations are used:
* Configuration in the project scope always overrides the Global configuration.
* Type-specific configuration always overrides the ~~All Types~~ configuration.

#info("Note that there is a separate workflow configuration applicable only to Work Items and Work Items types. This is the configuration used to map an overall process or methodology into Polarion. The configuration topic is: Administration &gt; Work Items &gt; Workflow.")
