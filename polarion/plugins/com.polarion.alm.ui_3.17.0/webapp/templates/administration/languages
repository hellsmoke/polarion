1.1 Languages Quick-Help
You can optionally configure Polarion to support multiple human language translations of Work Items. When correctly configured, a Title and Description field for one or more 
additional languages appear in the Work Item form in tracker views, and users can switch languages in Documents to view translated Work Items. \\

Before performing this configuration, you need to define 2 custom fields for each language you want to support: one for the translated Work Item title, and one for the description. 
The field for the title should be of type ~~string~~. The field for description should be of type ~~Rich Text (multi-line)~~. You need to define this field pair 
for each Work Item type that needs to support multiple languages, and in each Work Item custom field configuration you need this field pair for each language that 
must be supported. 

1.1.1 Default Language
The first item in the table on this page is the configured label for the Document Editor menu item that enables users to switch from a translation to the portal default language. 
In English versions of the Polarion portal, the value is the English string ~~Default Language~~.

1.1.1 Adding Languages
*IMPORTANT:* Before adding a Language, be sure you have already defined the necessary custom fields for all Work Item types that will have support for the language. \\ 

To add support for an additional language, click *Add New Language*. You will be prompted to specify a name. Users will see this name in the user interface for references to this 
language. For example, if the target language is German, you might specify either ~~German~~ or ~~Deutsch~~. \\

On the language configuration page, you specify all the Work Item types that you want to have support for the language. If you select ~~All Types~~ the configuration will apply to 
new Work Items of all types, but not to existing Work Items of any type. To have it apply to existing items, you will need to add a type-specific configuration.

For complete information on this configuration, including the configuration of supporting custom fields, please see Help: Administrator's Guide: Configuring the Portal: ~~Configuring Languages~~.
