1.1 Quick Help
This is where you can specify default Favorite Shortcuts for the current repository or project group. The shortcuts you configure here are recommendations for project users when they open the 
project group or repository. \\

You can also configure default Favorite Shortcuts in each project which override the ones you configure here when users open projects. In projects, user can create their own Favorite Shortcuts  
to give themselves quick access to the content they need most frequently.
