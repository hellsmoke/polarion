1.1 Quick Help

1.1.1 LDAP Server Connection Settings

1.1.1.1.1.1 LDAP Host Url
The Url of the LDAP server, e.g. ldap://localhost:389

1.1.1.1.1.1 User ID Attribute
The LDAP attribute that constitutes the user ID for Polarion users. It is usually ~~uid~~ or ~~sAMAccountName~~. For Active Directory it is displayed as "Login Name (for systems older than Windows 2000)" in the Active Directory administration. \\ 

Make sure that a Polarion user ID does not contain non US-ASCII or any other unsupported characters (i.e. \/:?\"<>|#';$^`%~ [space]).

1.1.1.1.1 User Search Options
The set of user nodes that Polarion is aware of and can synchronize with. (The intersection of a set of nodes below a base node that satisfies a search filter, optionally in the whole sub-tree, and a set of nodes in an LDAP group if the user group is configured).

1.1.1.1.1.1 Base DN
The name of the LDAP node to search for users in. Often in the form <tt>cn=Users,dc=company,dc=com</tt>.

1.1.1.1.1.1 Search Filter 
A Filter expression that refines found user results. (Can be any valid LDAP query). When doing the search it is concatenated (linked) with <tt>& USER_ID_ATTRIBUTE=*</tt>. 

1.1.1.1.1.1 Search Subtree
Set to "~~false~~" to limit the search to users directly under the base DN.

1.1.1.1.1.1  Search Size Limit
Limits the number of users in the search result. If the search returns a higher number of users, an error will occur.

1.1.1.1.1 User Group Options

1.1.1.1.1.1 Group DN
The name of the LDAP node that represents a group of Polarion users, e.g. in the form <tt>cn=Polarion Users,dc=company,dc=com</tt>.
 
1.1.1.1.1.1 Group Member Attribute
A multi-valued attribute of a group DN node that contains the members of a group. (Often a member from the ~~groupOfNames~~ object class ).

1.1.1.1.1 Bind Options
1.1.1.1.1.1 Bind DN
The name to use when searching for users. Leave this field empty for an anonymous search.

1.1.1.1.1.1 Bind Password
The bind password can be set using the <tt>ldap.bind.password</tt> Polarion property. (In the <tt>polarion.properties</tt> file).

1.1.1 User Synchronization with LDAP

1.1.1.1.1.1 Enable LDAP Synchronization
The above synchronization of user accounts with an LDAP server is not available until the ~~Enable LDAP Synchronization~~ box is checked. If left unchecked, the accounts of auto-created users will not be updated with information from the LDAP server.

1.1.1.1.1 Mappings
An unlimited number of LDAP user attributes can be mapped to Polarion <tt>Name</tt>, <tt>Email</tt> and <tt>Description</tt> user fields. The first applicable mapping is always used. (A mapping is applied if the attributes present in the mapping string are present and populated in the LDAP user node.)
* Name Mapping , e.g. <tt>%firstName% %lastName%</tt>
* Email Mapping , e.g. <tt>%uid%@mydomain.com</tt>
* Description Mappings , e.g. <tt>%description%</tt>

1.1.1.1.1 User Roles
Global roles for users created by LDAP synchronization can be set using the Polarion <tt>rolesForNewUserAccount</tt> system property in the <tt>polarion.properties</tt> file.\\
This file resides on the server's file system: \\
* Windows: <tt>%POLARION_HOME%\\\polarion\\\configuration</tt> \\
* Linux: <tt>%POLARION_HOME%/etc/</tt>

1.1.1 Alternative Authentication via LDAP in a Single Sign-on Environment

1.1.1.1.1.1 Allow for Web Services
Allows for credentialed authentication against the configured LDAP server. (If Polarion is configured for single sign-on authentication.) This setting is needed when using Web Service clients that cannot use single sign-on authentication.

1.1.1.1.1.1 Allow for e-Signatures
Enables the validation of electronic signatures against the configured LDAP server. (If Polarion is configured for single sign-on authentication.)
