1 Read-only Fields Configuration

*View:* [hatName]
\\
*Work Item Type:* [typeName]

{readonlyfields:[hatId]|type=[typeId]}

1.1 Quick Help
Standard Work Item fields as well as custom fields specified in the ~~Fields~~ input will be read-only when a Work Item has the status defined by the particular ~~Status ID~~. \\

Note that read-only fields should ~~not~~ be considered as a security feature. Administrators should be sure to properly configure user permissions, among other things.

1.1.1.1.1 Available Statuses
A list of available statuses is defined in Administration &gt; Work Items &gt; Enumerations &gt; status-enum.xml, *{hyperlink:/administration/workitems/enumerations}*.\\
Two constants are defined for ~~Status ID~~:
* ~~_default~~ - this configuration is used when no status-specific configuration exists
* ~~_create~~ - this configuration is used when a new Work Item is in process of being created but is not yet saved

1.1.1.1.1 Making Most Fields Read-only 
The special *<tt>@all</tt>* command used in the ~~Fields~~ column enables you to more easily specify just a few writable fields making all other fields read-only. When specified, 
all standard and custom fields in the Work Item form will be read-only. You can then specify exceptions by listing fields to be writable, using the prefix '*-*' (dash character) 
before each field ID, delimiting everything with commas: \\ 

~~SYNTAX:~~ <tt>@all,\[-field1,-field2,...\]</tt> \\

~~EXAMPLE:~~ \\
*StatusID:* <tt>_default</tt> *Fields:* <tt>@all,-status,-comments,-assignee</tt> \\

With the above, all standard and custom fields are read-only for the specified status ~~except~~ fields <tt>status</tt>, <tt>comments</tt> and <tt>assignee</tt>.
