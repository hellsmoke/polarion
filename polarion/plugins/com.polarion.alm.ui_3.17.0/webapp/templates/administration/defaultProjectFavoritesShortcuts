1.1 Quick Help
This is where you can specify default Favorite Shortcuts for the current project. Shortcuts specified here override any default Favorite Shortcuts defined for the parent project group 
and/or repository. The shortcuts you configure here are simply recommendations for project users, who can (and most likely will) create their own Favorite Shortcuts that take them to pages 
and information they most need in the project. \\
