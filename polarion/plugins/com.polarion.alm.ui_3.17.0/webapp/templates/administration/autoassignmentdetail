1.1 Quick Help

1.1 Rule

An Auto-assignment rule specifies the condition(s) under which a Work Item is automatically assigned, and the users to whom it is assigned if the condition(s) is/are satisfied. An Auto-assignment rule must specify one or more conditions and one or more assignees.

1.1.1 Condition

A Condition specifies the criteria that must be matched by a Work Item data field value in order for the condition to be satisfied, and a Work Item auto-assigned. \\ 

A Condition may specify one or more Work Item fields. Each field should be specified on a separate row in the ~~Conditions~~ table. Click the + icon in the ~~Actions~~ column to add rows. \\ 


#info("All field conditions must be satisfied for entire Condition to be satisfied. An empty condition is always satisfied.")

1.1.1.1 Field ID

Field ID is case sensitive. A field condition can have multiple values defined. A field condition is satisfied when the field matching the ID specified in the ~~Fields~~ column  has any of the specified values, or none of the specified values, depending on your selection in the drop-down list. \\

A list of standard field IDs is provided below.

1.1.1.1.1 Field condition

Select a value to specify that the field must match any or none in ~~Value(s)~~.

1.1.1.1.1 Value(s)

Enter a text string specifying the value which, if the field contains it, satisfies this field condition. Values are not case sensitive. For example, if ~~Field ID~~ is "status", you might specify the value "open".

1.1.1.1 Assignees

Specify one or more users to whom a Work Item will be automatically assigned when everything specified in Conditions is satisfied. 

1.1.1.1.1 User

Select the name of a user from the list. If you want assignment to multiple users, then for each additional assignee click the "*+*" icon in the ~~Actions~~ column and select a user name. 

#info("&lt;assignee&gt;&lt;project-lead/&gt;&lt;/assignee&gt; to assign to current project leader ")
