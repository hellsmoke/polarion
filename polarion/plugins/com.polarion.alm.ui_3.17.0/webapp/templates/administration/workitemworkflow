1.1 Quick Help
The table above shows the workflow configurations currently defined for *Work Items*. In general, configurations can be Global or project in their scope. The ~~Scope~~ column indicates the scope of 
the configuration currently in use. A Work Item workflow configuration can also be specific to one or more Work Item types. \\

There are two simple rules that define the order in which configurations are used:
* Configuration in the project scope always overrides the Global configuration.
* Type-specific configuration always overrides the ~~All Types~~ configuration.

1.1.1 Process Mapping
The Work Item workflow configuration can be used to map ~~any~~ process into Polarion to control the steps that artifacts (Work Items) must pass through during processing, ensuring that no steps are 
skipped or forgotten. \\ 

Before you spend a lot of time customizing Work Item workflows, you might check the project templates that come the Polarion product(s) you have. Project templates are pre-configured with workflows 
supporting common processes such as V-model and SCRUM. You may find you can use these workflows "out of the box", or that you can use them as a base and just add a few customizations of 
your own. Either way can save you significant time. \\ 

You might also check the Polarion Extensions Portal ([http://extensions.polarion.com >http://extensions.polarion.com]) for custom [workflow extensions >http://extensions.polarion.com/searches?category=3-workflow] and additional [project templates >http://extensions.polarion.com/searches?category=1-templates].
