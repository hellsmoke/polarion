1 Form Filter Configuration

*View:* [hatName]
\\
*Work Item Type:* [typeName]

{formfilter:[hatId]|type=[typeId]}

1.1 Quick Help
To show fields in Work Item form when a user activates filtering, add the desired field IDs to the ~~Fields~~ input, separated by ',' (comma).\\
To omit a field when filtering is applied, use the "-" (minus) prefix. E.g. use "@all,-severity" to display all fields ~~except~~ severity.\\ 
There is no hierarchical selecting of filters. Either whatever is inside an action or status element is used, or no filter is applicable.

1.1.1.1.1 Available Actions and Statuses
A list of available actions and statuses is defined in Administration &gt; Work Items &gt; Workflow,  *{hyperlink:/administration/workitems/workflow}*.\\
Two constants are defined for ~~Action ID~~:
* ~~_default~~ - this configuration is used when no action-specific configuration exists.
* ~~_create~~ - this configuration is used when a new Work Item is in process of being created but is not yet saved
A constant is defined for ~~Status ID~~:
* ~~_default~~ - this configuration is used when no status-specific configuration exists

*You can use special commands to specify a number of fields. For example:*\\
~~@all~~ - all fields of the current Work Item can be edited in the form\\
~~@allCustomFields~~ - all custom fields of the current Work Item\\
~~@required~~ - all required fields are marked in edited Work Item form with asterisk\\
