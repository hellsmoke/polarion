Query syntax that retrieves Work Items that should be planned.

1.1.1.1.1.1 Roles for Dependency Relationships
Specifies which configured link roles signify a dependency relationship between Work Items linked with the role. Thus, if Work Item "A" is linked with Work Item "B" using one of these link roles, then "A" would be planned after "B".

1.1.1.1.1.1 Enable Work Item Splitting
If checked, then when Polarion searches for a time slot for a Work Item in the project plan, it may decide to split the Work Item in two or more pieces, thereby making use of time periods before the Work Item is fixed or postponed by a planning constraint, so that the resulting plan is more optimal in terms of priorities.

1.1.1.1.1.1 Enable Due Date Planning
If this option is set to true, Work Items having values set in the Due Date or Time Point fields are given preference in the planning order. That is, they will be planned before Work Items having no value specified in these fields, with exceptions for any values specified in Planning Constraints).
