1 Calculated Fields Configuration

*Work Item Type:*&nbsp;&nbsp; [typeName]
\\
{calculated-fields-detail:[typeName]|type=[typeId]}

1.1 Quick Help
Aggregation of the values is always done according to a parent-child hierarchy of linked Work Items defined by link roles having the attribute ~~Parent~~ in Administration &gt; Work Items &gt; Enumerations &gt; workitem-link-role-enum.xml,  *{hyperlink:/administration/workitems/enumerations}*.\\
Currently *sum*, *multiply*, *average*, *min* and *max* calculations are supported.

1.1.1.1.1 Supported Field Types
Supported types are: 
* integer
* float
* currency
* duration
In case of *currency* or *duration* type a calculated field's type *must be the same* as that of the fields from which it is calculated. \\
Multiplication of fields with *duration* type is not supported.

1.1.1.1.1 Available Fields
The following are the IDs of fields whose value can be derived from a calculation (i.e., fields which can be configured as calculated fields).
* <tt>initialEstimate</tt>
* <tt>timeSpent</tt>
* <tt>remainingEstimate</tt>
