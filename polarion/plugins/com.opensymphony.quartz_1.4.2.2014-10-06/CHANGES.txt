lib/commons-logging.jar
 - org.apache.commons.logging.impl.LogFactoryImpl was modified to overcome
   problems in eclipse ("org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger does not implement Log").
   The change is in method loadClass(String), where lines
         ClassLoader threadCL = getContextClassLoader();
         if (threadCL != null) {
           try {
             return threadCL.loadClass(name);
           } catch( ClassNotFoundException ex ) {
             // ignore
           }
         }
  were commented out.
