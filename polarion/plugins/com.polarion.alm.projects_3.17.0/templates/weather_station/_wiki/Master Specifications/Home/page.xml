1 Master Specifications 
Master Specifications are Documents that contain all component specifications of products in a product line, such as feature requirements, test cases, etc.

This space provides pre-defined Documents that you can use to specify requirements and test cases.

1.1.1 OBJECTIVE
Develop a validated set of requirement Documents that meet the stakeholdersâ€™ needs. Connect specifications to Features through the Restrictions editor using the special restrictions syntax. (See User Guide: Managing Variants in Help for more information.)

1.1.1  INPUT

{portallink:/wiki/Features/Feature%20Model | addcontext=yes}Feature Model{portallink} - The Requirements from Master Specifications are constrained to Features: a Requirement item may only be relevant when a specific Feature is included in a Variant.

Add:
* Applicable statutes, regulations, and policies 
* Constraints (required legacy system interfaces, hardware/software platform, etc.) 
* Restrictions to connect Requirements and Test Cases from Master Specifications to Features

1.1.1 OUTPUT
Requirements and Test Specification Documents that collect information for all product variants.
