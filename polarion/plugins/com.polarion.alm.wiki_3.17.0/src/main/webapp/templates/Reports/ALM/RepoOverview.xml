*GETTING STARTED TIP*\\
Administrators/Managers of a new Polarion ALM installation: you can replace this content, and any content  on this page with your own to make it the wiki portal for your development organization. \\
 
This is a good place to create links to wiki resources that you create which are of general interest to all users of your Polarion ALM portal. For example, you might create wiki spaces/pages containing: 
   * overviews and key contacts of your organization and teams 
   * documentation of your technical resources and standards 
   * process and/or coding guidelines
   * team or organization unit spaces and/or home pages 

The list of possibilities is endless. Do some thinking and planning, and create a few key wiki pages. Then when you are ready to modify this page, click the ~~Edit~~ button above and use the wiki editor in Wiki Mark-up or Rich Text mode to modify the page content. Syntax help is available in the editor.\\

*Once again, welcome... and thanks for using Polarion ALM!*
